        <p class="card-text"> Winter of Code is a program aimed to increase participation for the Google Summer of Code program among students in colleges and universities.

            Winter of Code is here to light up your winter spirits with the wide world of open source development. This initiative aims to prepare you for the grand Google Summer of Code. Join us for a month-long programming project with an open-source organisation.
            
            As a part of the Winter of Code, students are paired with mentors from the participating organisation. This initiative aims at developing your skills in real-world software development in a wide range of specializations. In turn, the participating organisation gets to know your potential and also gives you the correct exposure that you need in your formative years. Above all, we hope you get encouraged into the world of open source and develop more code for the benefit of all.</p>
